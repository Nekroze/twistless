Twistless
---------

A simple to use bridge between stackless python (available in pypy) and the
twisted networking library.

The underlying implementation is based off of the excelent article by Stephen
Coursen found here
http://www.stevecoursen.com/209/stackless-python-meets-twisted-matrix/ and
gives a good place to start working with twisted and stackless.

   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Twistless's documentation!
=====================================

A simple to use bridge between stackless python (available in pypy) and the
twisted networking library.

The underlying implementation is based off of the excelent article by Stephen
Coursen found here
http://www.stevecoursen.com/209/stackless-python-meets-twisted-matrix/ and
was a huge help when writing *twistless*.

*Twistless* is designed to give a quick and easy start to using stackless
python and twisted together. The following shows an overly brief example of a
twisted reactor being started with stackless support.
